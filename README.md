## Description
This program displays the number of arguments from the command line and lists each one on the console.
I wrote a program written in C using some functions such as argc and argv which are argument count and argument vector respectively. I used them to count the number of arguments and to store each argument in a separate vector or array. Then I added print statements running on a for loop with counter as number of arguments. This prints each argument on command line and the first argument is the file name itself.
